# IN NEED OF IMPLEMENTATION

-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Remove all proptests for IO::Handle.new's attribute-setting

Continuing from [R#2039](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2039),
we'll likely want to diminish what IO::Handle.new does or even forbid
calling the method entirely.

Right now only `:$path` argument to `.new` is required for operation
of the handle. All other attributes can be set from `.open` call. There
are some proptests in `S32-io/io-handle.t` that test attributes can be
set via `.new`. Those proptests need to be removed (check `S32-io/io-cathandle.t`
for anything related that needs to be removed too).
