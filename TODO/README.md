# List of TODO items required for 6.d language release

## FEATURES

The [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) lists the proposed features that need to be
implemented by their stakeholders.

## Documentation Website

Implement ability to mark features with the language version they first
appeared in.

## Roast

Review [all the new tests since
6.c](https://github.com/perl6/roast/compare/HEAD...6.c-errata) to ensure they
do belong in 6.d and test desired behaviour.

## Feature List

Collect all the features that will be new in 6.d. Many are already implemented,
documented, and are in use, but they're not part of 6.c language
(e.g. `Str.parse-base`)
