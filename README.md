All The Thingsâ„¢ still left to do to prepare for 6.d "Diwali" language release

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**NOTE: this repository is largely internal to core developers.**

If you have a language change proposal, please file it in
https://github.com/perl6/roast/issues/new rather than this repo.

The Issues in this repo are for discussing changes already slated
for 6.d language release, which would largely be the items in
[`TODO/FEATURES.md`](TODO/FEATURES.md) /
[`TODO/completed-FEATURES.md`](TODO/completed-FEATURES.md) documents.

The information in this repo should not be seen as guaranteed
and fully qualified language changes for 6.d language. It does NOT even contain
all the changes yet, as many of them were OK to be implemented without requiring
use of 6.d pragma.
