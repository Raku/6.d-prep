All The Things to prepare for 6.d "Diwali" language release

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**NOTE: this repository is largely internal to core developers.**

If you have a language change proposal, please file it in
https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/new rather than this repo.

The Issues in this repo are for discussing changes already slated
for 6.d language release, which would largely be the items in
[`TODO/FEATURES.md](TODO/FEATURES.md) /
[`TODO/completed-FEATURES.md`](TODO/completed-FEATURES.md) documents.

The information in this repo should not be seen as guaranteed
and fully qualified language changes for 6.d language.
